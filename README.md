Use Xcodeâ€™s new Swift Packages option, which is located within the File menu.

## Usage example

[ExampleApp](https://github.com/VladimirBrejcha/LoadingViewExample)

```Swift
import LoadingView

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    @IBOutlet weak var loadingView: LoadingView!
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        loadingView.repeatTouchUpHandler = { button in
            // handle repeatButton touches
        }
        loadingView.state = .loading // set loadingView state
    }
}
```

## States

#### hidden
View is fully hidden
#### loading

#### info

#### error

## Advanced

### Use your own animations instead of default PulsingCircleAnimation

Create an animation and conform it to the [Animation](Sources/LoadingView/Animation.swift) protocol.
Set the loadingAnimation property.
```Swift
loadingView.loadingAnimation = MyAnimation() // must conform to Animation protocol
```

### Turn on state change logging

```Swift
loadingView.logStateChanges = true // enable logging if needed
```
